      I descended down the steps quietly. The night sky that was barely
      illuminating the tomb earlier had completely gone out of sight. I barely
      clung to the walls of the chasm to make sure I didn’t lose my footing as I
      slowly made my way down. After walking for a long time, I suddenly saw a
      small light at the bottom. In all my excitement at seeing the light, I
      missed a step and lost my footing.
    </div>

    <div>
      I screamed as I tumbled down in the dark, my body receiving blows from
      everywhere until I finally came to a rest. There, lying in the darkness,
      tired, hungry, thirsty, fatigued and hurt, I closed my eyes and my
      consciousness faded away.
    </div>

    <div>
      When I opened my eyes, it was already daytime. The ample sunlight was able
      to light up the hole from where I had fallen. I lifted my head to look
      around and saw a strange room. It was like a small study room with a
      table, chair and a few cupboards. What caught my eye first, was a bottle
      of water kept on the table. I raised myself with much difficulty and
      reached for the bottle. In doing so, my hand hit a file and lots of papers
      flew and got scattered on the floor.
    </div>

    <div>
      I grabbed the bottle and emptied it in my mouth. I fell down on the floor,
      gasping for air and feeling relieved. My stomach grumbled to remind me
      that I had only satiated my thirst, not my hunger. After a few minutes, I
      got up and observed the room carefully. I saw the steps ending near the
      floor of the room. There was a small bulb at the other end of the room,
      probably the light I had seen when I was descending. There was a table and
      a comfortable chair behind it. Behind the chair, there was a door. I
      sighed, knowing that there was no way that the door would be just open for
      me. I went to the door and tried to unlock it, but it was heavily bolted.
      There was a small circular keyhole on the door. I tried to look through it
      but I couldn’t see anything.
    </div>

    <div>
      I picked up the papers that had fallen down and arranged them carefully in
      the file. I sat down on the chair and went through the drawers, hoping to
      find some food, only to find myself disappointed. I leaned back on the
      chair and looked around. My eyes catched the hold of an orange and black
      file titled: “Auxin” I picked up the file and started to read all the
      documents. The first page said,
    </div>

    <div>Dedicated to You, Powered by Auxin,</div>
    <div>https://getauxin.com/</div>

    <div>
      Auxin was a project which was started by a group of teen coders, inspired
      by the concept of self learning. All of the members had learnt how to code
      by watching youtube videos and wanted to help other self-learners like
      themselves to develop their skill sets. The main principle behind their
      ideas was that education was an extremely important resource that should
      be made equally available for everyone. Their theory completely rejected
      the idea of different quality and standards of education for different
      people. Education was something so precious, that everyone deserved to
      receive the same quality of educational services regardless of sex, age or
      socio-economic background.
    </div>

    <div>
      The developers at Auxin were highly motivated and started out with a
      different name. They tried to develop a tool that would enhance the
      learning experience of any user watching any tutorial on any platform they
      wanted. With high spirits, the team set out on their journey. But all did
      not go as planned. Due to some internal conflicts and mismanagement, they
      could never complete the project. They tried to restart the project by
      renaming themselves as Auxin, but their ideas could not reach the masses
      and they remained hidden in the shadows.
    </div>

    <div>
      The team finally made a decision. They would hold some kind of test to see
      if their ideas could survive. They worked on one final project called
      ‘Halocrypt’ to see if they themselves were worthy of carrying forward
      their ideas or not.
    </div>

    <div>
      My hands trembled slightly as I reached the last page of the file. There
      was a short message written on the last page.
    </div>

    <div>
      “You’re the only one who can save us. Prove we’re worthy. Show them we can
      survive.”
    </div>

    <div>“ESCAPE THE CRYPT IF YOU’RE WORTHY”</div>
